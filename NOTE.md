## Ideas

- Have a menu option for flipping betweek crank for Start/Select and crank for
  Left/Right. Could be cool in something like Mario.
- Obviously needs some kind of ROM selection screen
- Save states (may need support in `gbrs`)
- Sound (needs audio support in `crankstart`)
- ROM browser (how are we drawing the UI?)
- A way to clear/manage save files without using Playdate OS' "Clear Game Data",
  because that would delete all your ROMs too.
