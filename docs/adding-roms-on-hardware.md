# Adding games to Playboy

<p align="right">(on real hardware)</p>

## Connect your Playdate in disk mode

On your device, press and hold Left, the Menu button, and the Lock button for
3 seconds to start your Playdate in "disk mode".

Now, you can plug your Playdate into your computer via USB, and it will show up
as an external drive.

## Copy games to the Data folder

Now, double click on the `Data` folder, then you should see a folder with `playboy` in the name.

Depending on how you installed the `.pdx`, it might be in the format "`me.overflo.playboy`", or
"`user.1234.playboy`"

> If you don't see the folder in `Data`, run Playboy on your device at least once to create it.

Paste your games into this folder. Make sure the files end in `.gb` - if they came
in a `.zip` file, unzip them first.

Add as many as you like, you'll be able to pick between them.

## Naming files

Games show up in Playboy named the same as the files in the data folder.

Give your `.gb` files useful names so that you'll recognise which game they are.
